## Notes for Website Rebuild
1. The domain nolanmuaythai.com is live but shows completely different content ("NEW MUAY THAI" life coaching template). This may indicate the gym has rebranded or the site was handed to someone else.
2. The new address (Orpington) differs from the original (Beckenham). Could be a move or a different business entirely.
3. The search engine index still shows the OLD cached content with Beckenham Boxing Club details — this will eventually update.
4. Liam Nolan's personal social media still references the gym and coaching.
5. The Patreon and Liam Harrison Training links suggest he also does online coaching independently.
